<h3>WEb Content Accessibility Guideline Improvements</h3>
<p> While checking my website for usability issues I found the language of the document was not defined. This was an error because identifying the language of the page allows screen readers to read the content in the appropriate language. It also facilitates automatic translationof content. I corrected the mistake by adding the tag,< html lang = "en" > in the heading of the code.<br> 
I also found that the home tab at the top of the page also had issues. The tab acted as a link to another location within the page but it did not have a corresponding target. This is significant because a link to jump to another position within the page assists users in navigating the web page, but only if the link target exists. I corrected this issue by removing the page link. </p>
